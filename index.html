                        <h2>WELCOME TO SHRYWAVE</h2>

                        <h3>Origin Story – The Beginning of a Wave</h3><br>
<p>Every creation has a spark — a moment, a reason, a feeling that gives birth to something beautiful. For me, that spark was the art of writing. I’ve always felt that writing is not just about putting words together, it’s about giving shape to thoughts, emotions, and memories that otherwise fade away silently.</p>

<p>I started ShryWave because I wanted to share my words with the world — my feelings, my observations, my life’s little victories and heartbreaks. Writing was never just a hobby for me; it was a voice for the things my heart wanted to say. </p>

<p>I’ve seen how a single sentence can make someone smile, how a story can take someone away from their reality into another world, and how a poem can heal a wound no one else can see. That is the magic I wanted to give to others.</p>

 <blockquote>ShryWave is my way of saying, “Here I am, this is my journey, and I hope it resonates with yours.”</blockquote>
               
                          <br><br>  <hr><br><br>   
<h3> The Meaning of the Name – A Piece of Two Lives</h3><br>
<p>Names carry stories. Some names are chosen because they sound beautiful, but ShryWave was chosen because it holds a piece of my life — and hers.</p>

<p>The “SH” comes from the last two letters of my own name, Nitish. The “RY” comes from the first and middle letters of a girl named Riya. She wasn’t just any girl — she was the first girl in my life whom I truly loved. She was the one who taught me what love feels like, how respect is the foundation of every relationship, and how simplicity is the most beautiful form of elegance.</p>

<p>She helped me become a better human being — more understanding, more mature, and more compassionate. She had a beauty that wasn’t just about her face but about the way she carried herself — simple, yet unforgettable. Even though our lives took different paths, the lessons she gave me stayed, and in some ways, she still lives in my words.</p>

<p>“Wave” represents the flow of life — constant, ever-moving, sometimes calm, sometimes stormy. Just like a wave, my writing carries emotions to distant shores, reaching people I may never meet, but still touching their hearts.</p>

<p>So ShryWave is not just a name; it’s a memory, a tribute, and a symbol of how love and life’s lessons can shape who we are.</p>
                  
 <br><br>  <hr><br><br>
<h3>My Passions – What I Share Through ShryWave</h3><br>
<P>ShryWave is my canvas, and I paint on it with words. I write about:</P>

Experiences – Real moments from my life, lessons I’ve learned, and thoughts that keep me awake at night.<br>

Travelling – Every journey changes you in some way, and I capture those changes in my words.<br>

Poems – For me, poetry is where emotions find their rhythm.<br>

Autobiographies – Small chapters of my own life, written as I live them.<br>

Stories – Sometimes real, sometimes imagined, but always meaningful.<br>

<p>I believe every piece I write should either make you think, make you feel, or make you dream.</p>

<br><br>  <hr><br><br>
<h3>Writing Philosophy – Waves of Truth & Imagination</h3><br>
<p>I’ve always believed that every story carries truth — even if it’s hidden inside fantasy. When I write, it’s usually drawn from something real: a feeling, a memory, a face I once knew, or a moment I once lived.</p>

<p>Sometimes I write pure reality, sometimes I mix it with imagination. But one thing stays the same — there is always meaning. I don’t write to fill pages; I write to fill hearts.</p>

<p>I think of each piece of writing like a wave — it rises with emotion, travels with purpose, and eventually reaches someone who needs it.</p>

    <br><br>  <hr><br><br>

<h3>Future Vision – A Legacy in Words</h3><br>
<p>I know one truth about life: one day, all of us will leave this world behind. But what we create, the work we do for ourselves and for others, remains. It becomes a part of someone’s memory, someone’s story.</p>

<p>When my time here is done, I don’t want to be remembered just by my name. I want people to remember me through my words, my stories, and the emotions I’ve left behind. I want ShryWave to be a place where people still come long after I’m gone — to feel inspired, to feel understood, to feel less alone.</p>

<p>My dream is that my stories will live in people’s hearts, not as my stories, but as their stories too.</p>


  <br><br>  <hr><br><br>
<h3>An Invitation to You</h3><br>
<p>ShryWave is not just mine anymore — it belongs to anyone who visits, reads, and feels something here. Whether you came for a story, a poem, a travel diary, or just a few words to make your day lighter, I hope you find something worth staying for.</p>

<p>So, welcome. Ride the waves with me. Let’s create a journey made of words, emotions, and unforgettable moments.</p>

                       <div> <h3>The Meaning of My Name – Nittyshry Prabhu</h3><br> 
<p>Every name carries a story, and mine is stitched together with love, respect, and memories of the people who shaped me.</p>
<hr><br>
<p><b>“Nitty”</b> is what my mother has called me with affection since I was a child. It’s not just a nickname — it’s the sound of home. Whenever I hear it, I am reminded of her care, her warmth, and the countless sacrifices she has made to see me happy. It’s a name that makes me feel safe, no matter where I am in the world.</p>
<br><hr>
<p><b>“Shry”</b> is formed from two special parts — the last two letters of my own name Nitish (“SH”) and the first and middle letters of Riya (“RY”), the first girl I truly loved. She wasn’t just a chapter in my life — she was a teacher of the heart. She showed me what love means, taught me to respect everyone, and helped me grow into a simpler, wiser person.</p>
<br><hr>
<p><b>“Prabhu”</b> is my father’s name — a badge of honor I carry with pride. It reminds me of his guidance, his strength, and his unwavering belief in me. Every time I write or speak my name, I feel I’m carrying forward his legacy.</p>
<br><hr>
<p>So, <b>Nittyshry Prabhu</b> is more than just my identity. It is my parents’ love, my first love’s memory, and the values that have shaped me into who I am today. It is not just a name — it is a story, a journey, and a promise to live with meaning.</p></div>

                        <p><h3>Friends,</h3><br>
<h4>I always want to capture every moment that comes in my life (in my phone's camera, in my diary, in my mind so that I never forget it).<br><br>
I live every moment always, whether it is a beautiful moment, sometimes a sad moment, sometimes a moment of struggle, every moment that comes in my life, friend.</h4><br>
<h3>Let's talk about me -</h3><br>
                            I am a passionate creative artist driven by the belief that art has the power to inspire, connect, and leave a lasting impact. My journey began with a deep love for storytelling, which gradually expanded into filmmaking, acting, and music composition.</p>
                        <p>
Currently pursuing a Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science and Engineering, I balance academics with creativity, using my technical foundation to enhance my artistic vision. My goal is to craft meaningful films, powerful performances, and soulful music that resonate deeply with audiences.</p>
                        <p>Though I never initially saw myself as a writer, my perspective changed in 2021 (11th grade) when I realized the power of storytelling. I decided to start writing with the dream of one day turning my scripts into films—stories that bring positive, impactful content to society.</p>
                        <p>
As a multifaceted creative, I constantly refine my skills in screenwriting, acting, editing, photography, and web design. I believe in collaborative growth and working with like-minded artists who share a passion for innovation and authentic storytelling.<br><br>My vision is clear: To create. To inspire. To leave a mark.
